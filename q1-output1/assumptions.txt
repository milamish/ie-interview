Assumptions:
1. The given vertex at index 0 is chosen as the reference point for scaling.
2. Scaling is applied independently along each axis (x, y, z) based on the provided scaling factors.
3. The cuboid is assumed to have a certain orientation, and scaling is applied accordingly.
4. Visualization assumes a fixed orientation for the cuboid to show the effects of scaling clearly.
